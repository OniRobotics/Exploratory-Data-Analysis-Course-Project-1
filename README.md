# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Course-Project-1

This is my submission for Course Project 1 for the Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis by John Hopkins University.

I created plots for 2/1/2007-2/2/2007.

Plot 1 is a histogram of Global Active Power.

Plot 2 is a line graph of Global Active Power.

Plot 3 is a line graph of Sub Metering 1, 2, and 3

Plot 4 is a combined plot with the fourth plot as a line graph of Global Reactive Power
